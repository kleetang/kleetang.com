I gained **5 pounds** recently (within two months) -_- After a deep reflection, ok, I just thought about why??!, and I figured it's my unhealthy lifestyle betrays me.
**DE 1:** Oh, I work late, and I have no time to cook for next day's lunch. 
**DE 2:** Hmm, I don't like my company's dinner, and why cann't I eat when I get home. I know it is late, but the food is much more delicious.
**DE 3:** My ice cream is waiting in my frige >.<, it def need me! And btw, I work hard so I deserve a sweet.
**DE 4:** Why do I need to eat lunch? Err, how about just have a workout? It is healthier right?
**DE 5:** I wanna go to bed early, but I need eat something first, and then maybe just watch some youtube videos, oh, and read one book from the huge to-be-read pile. And wait, my cats' litter box need be cleaned today. What's the time now? It's already 12:30AM! See, I wanna go to bed early. I just cann't.
